# html-css-js-project-boilerplate

In this project, I have made a Movie Deck.

In the header, I have added a link to the site name which will navigate the user to the home page.

I have added a search bar, which later will be combined with debouncing search.

I have used the API from **themoviedb**.

I have also made two buttons that can be used to sort the list of movies displayed by Date or rating.

I have displayed the movies in tiles, as shown in the project.

The tiles contain:
  1. Movie Poster
  2. Movie Name
  3. Votes
  4. Rating

At the bottom of the page, I have added a previous, current, and next button to navigate between different pages and see more movies on the list.

Still in progress...
Also, we can add favorites by clicking the heart symbol on movie card. and access them in your favorites bar on the right of ALL.
